\description{
By bridging linear models, a model can be described in terms of other features.
}
\details{
This function was developed specifically with the intention to convert a 
linear model known as SKY92 - which uses AffyMetrix probe IDs - into a model
that is described in terms of Ensembl Gene IDs. 

The AffyMetrix ProbeIDs reflect gene transcript expressions, while the Ensembl
gene IDs summarize the genes as a whole. Some genes might be targeted by
none, one or multiple probes, and similarly, some probes might correspond to
no, one or multiple Ensembl gene IDs. Although there might not be a one-to-one
relationship, there is most often a high correlation between features expressed
in terms of AffyMetrix Probe IDs and other representations such as Ensembl Gene
IDs. 

The function uses the underlying covariance structure in the data to 
redistribute the weight of a model over new features.
